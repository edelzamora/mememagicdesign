## :clipboard: Project Information
### Task
- Spring 2021 Meme Magic Design
The year is 2006 and Google has just bought YouTube. As a budding tech entrepreneur, you've had a great idea for a killer new app that allows you to take a photo, apply a funny caption and share it with your friends. You call it a ‚Äúmeme.‚Äù
To get started with your app, you're going to need to design some classes. You sit down with your design team and get to work.

- The project is developed in phases or "sprints" with a total of 3 each with a scenario test.
#### Initial commit
- Design the classes and write method stubs, getters, setters, to strings, equals, etc.
#### Sprint 1
- This first sprint will include the Meme, BackgroundImage, and Rating classes. Writing constructors, methods and implementing classes.
